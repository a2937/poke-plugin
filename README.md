Poke Plugin
================
Pokemon plugin adds pokemon-themed commands to the Avaire Discord bot. 
## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avaire/starboard-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.
3. Profit. 

And you're done!
